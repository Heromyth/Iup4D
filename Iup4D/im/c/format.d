      DNG tags as they are described in the DNG documentation. See http://www.adobe.com/br/products/dng/
        Tags BlackLevel, DefaultCropOrigin and DefaultCropSize are incorrectly interpreted by libTIFF so they are ignored.

        SubIFDSelect IM_USHORT (1)   [Subifd number to be read. Must be set before reading image info.]
      (other attributes can be obtained by using libTIFF directly using the Handle(1) function)

    Comments:
      LogLuv is in fact Y'+CIE(u,v), so we choose to always convert it to XYZ.
      SubIFD is handled only for DNG.
      Since LZW patent expired, LZW compression is enabled. LZW Copyright Unisys.
      libGeoTIFF can be used without XTIFF initialization. Use Handle(1) to obtain a TIFF*.

    Changes:
      "tiff_jpeg.c" - commented "downsampled_output = TRUE" and downsampled_input = TRUE.
      "tiff_fax3.c" - replaced "inline" by "INLINE"
      "tif_strip.c" - fixed scanline_size
      New files "tif_config.h" and "tifconf.h" to match our needs.
      New file "tiff_binfile.c" that implement I/O rotines using imBinFile.

Reads only the first video stream. Other streams are ignored.
All the images have the same size, you must call imFileReadImageInfo/imFileWriteImageInfo 
at least once.

* \par
* ECW JPEG 2000 Copyright 1998 Earth Resource Mapping Ltd.
* Two formats are supported with this module. The ECW (Enhanced Compression Wavelet) format and the ISO JPEG 2000 format.
* \par
* Access to the ECW format uses the ECW JPEG 2000 SDK version 3.3. 
* Available in Windows, Linux and Solaris Only. But source code is also available. \n
* You must link the application with "im_ecw.lib" 
* and you must call the function \ref imFormatRegisterECW once 
* to register the format into the IM core library. \n
* Depends also on the ECW JPEG 2000 SDK libraries (NCSEcw.lib).
* \par
* When using other JPEG 2000 libraries the first registered library will be used to guess the file format. 
* Use the extension *.ecw to shortcut to this implementation of the JPEG 2000 format.

Comments:
Only read support is implemented.
To read a region of the image you must set the View* attributes before reading the image data.
After reading a partial image the width and height returned in ReadImageInfo is the view size.
The view limits define the region to be read. 
The view size is the actual size of the image, so the result can be zoomed.

* 
* \par
* Internal Implementation.
* \par
* Supports RAW binary images. This is an unstructured and uncompressed binary data. 
* It is NOT a Camera RAW file generated in many professional digital cameras. \n
* You must know image parameters a priori and must set the IM_INT attributes "Width", "Height", "ColorMode", "DataType" 
* before the imFileReadImageInfo/imFileWriteImageInfo functions.
* \par
* The data must be in binary form, but can start in an arbitrary offset from the begining of the file, use attribute "StartOffset".
* The default is at 0 offset. 
* \par
* Integer sign and double precision can be converted using attribute "SwitchType". \n
* The conversions will be BYTE<->CHAR, USHORT<->SHORT, INT<->UINT, FLOAT<->DOUBLE.
* \par
* Byte Order can be Little Endian (Intel=1) or Big Endian (Motorola=0), use the attribute "ByteOrder", the default is the current CPU.
* \par
* The lines can be aligned to a BYTE (1), WORD (2) or DWORD (4) boundaries, ue attribute "Padding" with the respective value.
* \par
* If the compression is ASCII the data is stored in textual format, instead of binary. 
* In this case SwitchType and ByteOrder are ignored, and Padding should be 0.
* \par
* When reading, if data type is BYTE, color space is RGB and data is packed, then the attribute "RGB16" is consulted. 
* It can has values "555" or "565" indicating a packed 16 bits RGB pixel is stored with the given bit distribution for R, G and B.

Comments:
IMPORTANT - The "image_count" and the "FPS" attribute may not be available from the file,
we try to estimate from the duration and from the average time between frames, or using the default value.
We do not handle DRM protected files (Digital Rights Management).
Reads only the first video stream. Other streams are ignored.
All the images have the same size, you must call imFileReadImageInfo/imFileWriteImageInfo 
at least once.
For optimal random reading, the file should be indexed previously.
If not indexed by frame, random positioning may not be precise.
Sequencial reading will always be precise.
When writing we use a custom profile and time indexing only.
We do not support multipass encoding.  
Since the driver uses COM, CoInitialize(NULL) and CoUninitialize() are called every Open/Close.
